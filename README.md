This is a small project implemented to understand K - means clustering to cluster the latitude and longitude points of Uber rides. 

From the top most cluster where there are frequently requested rides, I tried to find out the peak hours. 

Totally I divided the times into 24 range, where I noticed the times from 17-21 i.2 5PM - 9PM are most frequently used hours by riders.
