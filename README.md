This is a small project implemented to understand K - means clustering to cluster the latitude and longitude Gmaps points of Uber rides. 

From the topmost cluster, where there are frequently requested rides, I tried to find out the peak hours. 

I divided the times into 24 ranges, where I noticed the times from 17-21 i.e 5PM - 9 PM are the most frequently used hours by riders.
